## üöÄ Getting Started  

### Install Dependencies  
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:  

```bash
npm install
```
Start the App

To start the development server and test your app:

npx expo start

You can open the app in:
	‚Ä¢	A development build.
	‚Ä¢	Android emulator or iOS simulator.
	‚Ä¢	Expo Go, a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo.

üõ† Development

File-Based Routing

You can start developing by editing the files inside the app directory. This project uses file-based routing.

Reset the Project

If you need a fresh project:

npm run reset-project

This command will move the starter code to the app-example directory and create a blank app directory for development.

üì¶ Required Dependencies

To implement the features of StickerSmash, you‚Äôll need the following dependencies:
	1.	expo-image
```bash
npx expo install expo-image
```
	2.	expo-image-picker
```bash
npx expo install expo-image-picker
```

	3.	react-native-view-shot
```bash
npx expo install react-native-view-shot
```

	4.	expo-media-library
```bash
npx expo install expo-media-library
```

	5.	dom-to-image
```bash
npm install dom-to-image
npm i --save-dev @types/dom-to-image
```


‚ö†Ô∏è Known Bugs

The library react-native-view-shot may not work properly from React Native 0.72 onwards, as reported in this [issue](https://github.com/gre/react-native-view-shot/issues/482). The issue could come from expo go, as I have not tested it on production, and expo go is a limited simulator only.
